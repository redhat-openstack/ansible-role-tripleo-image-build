Role Name
=========

ansible-role-tripleo-image-build

Requirements
------------

This role requires libguestfs, virt-customize, virt-sparsify, and other dependencies via parts/kvm and parts/libvirt.

How does it work?
-----------------

tasks/main.yml After nuking the working directory:
* (repo_setup.yml)         Get the base image and setup yum repositories
* (package_install.yml)    Install packages for overcloud base image
* (convert_undercloud.yml) Use overcloud base image to create undercloud base image
* (dib_build.yml)          Use DIB to build the overlcloud-full and IPA images
* (undercloud_inject.yml)  Inject overcloud-full and IPA images into the undercloud image

Notes:
* The overcloud image is constructed by a series of calls to [virt-customize](http://libguestfs.org/virt-customize.1.html), part of [libguestfs](http://libguestfs.org/) to run scripts that call install packages directly to the qcow2.  Other utilities from this toolset are also used.
* The undercloud qcow is generated by starting with the overcloud and adding/removing a few packages.
* The overcloud image is then written --> undercloud image, so when undercloud.qcow2 is booted by [tripleo-quickstart](https://github.com/openstack/tripleo-quickstart/), the overcloud image is present and ready to be deployed.

Role Variables
--------------

The only required variable is {{ virthost }}, which is the hostname for where the images will be created.  Root access is required.

The defaults for image building are located at defaults/main.yml.  With no params specified (aside from virthost) this role will build images for:

* Mitaka (RDO, delorean, current-passed-ci)
* http://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos7-mitaka/{{ delorean_hash | default('current-passed-ci')}}/delorean.repo
* CentOS 7 base image
* Disk Image Builder (DIB) tools from liberty are used
* images are built in $virthost:/home/oooq-images

### To change or customize how images are built and what they contain, enabling scenarios such as:

* {rdo, rhos} x {centos, rhel}
* RPM's, container (future), built from source (future)
* additional test tools or configuration (be vocal, submit issues/blueprints!)

Variable                    | Description
--------                    | -----------
minimal_base_image_url      | base RHEL image for undercloud and overcloud
repo_script                 | Jinja2 template bash script used to install repositories on base image for binaries via virt-customize
dib_prepare_script          | Jinja2 template bash script used to prepare $virthost for building images with DIB  
working_dir                 | All artifacts are created here.  
release                     | (rdo only): mitaka, liberty
dib_elements_path           | defines ELEMENTS_PATH when calling disk-image-create
dib_workarounds             | enabled (true) by default, this causes an additional virt-customize pass specifically to massage DIB inputs for temporary workarouds
dib_workaround_script       | ^ the script for this
dib_remove_epel             | if true, removes epel from the DIB elements tree with hostility
dib_release_rpm             | where DIB itself comes from on $virthost.  Default: "http://rdoproject.org/repos/openstack-liberty/rdo-release-liberty.rpm"
dib_environment_additional  | dict() with key-value (NAME=value) settings for DIB (e.g. DIB_YUM_REPO_CONF).  These are added to the env just prior to running disk-image-create
undercloud_remove_packages  | the undercloud image is generated by starting with the overcloud, removing packages from, and adding packages to it.  This is the list of packages to remove  
undercloud_install_packages | ^ this is the list of packages to add
overcloud_package_list      | the set of packages installed (by yum) on the images.  Default: vars/default_package_list.yml
overcloud_images            | the list of artifacts that are packaged and published by invoking this role

Dependencies
------------

No other galaxy roles are leveraged.  libvirt and portions of KVM are used to build images.

Consumers of this role (known)
------------------------------
