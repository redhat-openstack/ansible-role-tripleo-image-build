      "message": "I had thought that up/down stream (rdo vs. rhos) would have the same package list, was trying to reduce clutter for the caller.  Also found it handy to be able to diff package lists, vs building a heirarchy/pipeline (\"newton is mitaka plus ___ minus ___\").  We do need to build kilo images downstream for upgrade testing.\n\nI\u0027m happy to change it to a single hard coded list and \noverride though. {shrug}\n\nIs there a \"source of truth\" re: tripleo and what the package list \"should\" be, that this default will need to be kept in sync with?",
