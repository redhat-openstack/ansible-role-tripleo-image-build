Maybe a good option is to just run once:\n\nrepoquery --plugins -a --qf \u0027%{repo} %{sourcerpm}\u0027|sort -u\n\nThis will generate a list of \"\u003crepo name\u003e \u003csource rpm\u003e\" for all packages in repos with priorities applied, as:\n\ndelorean openstack-nova-14.0.0-0.20160929203854.59653c6.el7.centos.src.rpm\n\nThis would allow to list the available srpms for each repo and with prioritization easily.",
